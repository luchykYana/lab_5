Today I saw our extraordinary "White Desert".
The young film director, Yurii Ivanovich Yanovsky, respectfully shook my hand and looked enthusiastically in the eyes.
He cannot express all his joy at the fact that he sees me.
He is glad that sees me healthy and invites me to his studio.
He, Franko Ivan Yakovych, studied cinematography from my books.
He will tell his colleagues at work that a great person (that's me) will make them happy with a visit.
his hand and was left alone.
"White Desert" is truly a masterpiece.
Such paintings appeared in us once every ten years and stood, like lighthouses.
